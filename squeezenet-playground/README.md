<h1>INSTRUCTIONS</h1><br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp This folder contains the source code and required files for the SqueezeNet Playground. However, you will have to download the Squeeze ImageNet model yourself via this <a href="https://github.com/rcmalli/keras-squeezenet/releases/download/v1.0/squeezenet_weights_tf_dim_ordering_tf_kernels.h5" >link</a> and include it in the project. All other files such as pictures and the python files can be linked with relative paths, ensure you maintain an absolute path for the <i>imagenet_class_index.json</i> file and the model file (usually <i>squeezenet_weights_tf_dim_ordering_tf_kernels.h5</i>) both in debug mode and production mode. Ensure installation path for the project is pre-determined and the <i>imagenet_class_index.json</i> file and model file is linked via this path.
