<div style="margin-left: 20px; max-width: 600px;"  > <p  style="font-family: Calibri;" > &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The <b> Machine Learning Model Playgrounds</b> is a project that is part of the dream of
         a team of Moses Olafenwa and John Olafenwa to bring current capabilities in machine learning and artificial intelligence into practical 
        use for non-programmers and average computer users. This project is the first step in what we hope will become
        mainstream application in modern technology in which Computers, Smartphones, Edge Devices and Systems will 
        have in-built state-of-the-art Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence capabilities without having to
        connect to cloud based services. <br>
        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The <b>Machine Learning Model Playgrounds </b> is a series of Windows programs built using pure 
        python libraries and code. Each of the programs is a user-friendly demo of Image Classification powered by
        a specific image classification model of popular Machine Learning Algorithms trained on the ImageNet (1000 object classes )
        dataset. Each program provides a user interface where users can select a picture from their Windows system folder
        while the program process the selected picture and give top-10 possible results of the objects detected with
        percentage probability per each result. <br><br>
        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp This repository contains the source code, models and builds of each of the programs in the
        <b>Model Playgrounds </b> series. It is provided to allow other developers outside our team to adapt, modify or extend
         the code to produce more programs that may be specific to a social, business, economic or scientific need. <br> <br>
         &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The dependencies used for this project are listed below: <br>
         &nbsp &nbsp  <b>- Python 3.5.2</b> <br>
