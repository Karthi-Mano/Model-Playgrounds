<h1>INSTRUCTIONS</h1><br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp This folder contains the source code and required files for the DenseNet Playground. However, you will have to download the DenseNet-121 ImageNet model yourself via this <a href="https://github.com/titu1994/DenseNet/releases/download/v3.0/DenseNet-BC-121-32.h5" >link</a> and include it in the project. All other files such as pictures and the python files can be linked with relative paths, ensure you maintain an absolute path for the <i>imagenet_class_index.json</i> file and the model file (usually <i>DenseNet-BC-121-32.h5</i>) both in debug mode and production mode. Ensure installation path for the project is pre-determined and the <i>imagenet_class_index.json</i> file and model file is linked via this path.
